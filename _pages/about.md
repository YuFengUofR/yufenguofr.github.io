I am a tenure-track assistant professor in John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Rochester.

During my Ph.D., I worked with [Prof. Yuhao Zhu](https://yuhaozhu.com/) who shows me the intricacy and excitment of computer system and computer archtecture. My main research interest is about efficient and high-performance `Mobile Visual Computing`. This topic is not only about how machines perceive visual information, but also how machines present visual information to us! My current interests include but are not limited to in-sensor computing, point cloud-based computing and XR rendering. Please drop me an email if you are interested in working with me.
