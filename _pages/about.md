I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/about/overview/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am also a member of the [Emerging Parallel Computing Center](http://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

Before joining SJTU, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Rochester. During my Ph.D., I worked with [Prof. Yuhao Zhu](https://yuhaozhu.com/). My main research interest is about efficient and high-performance `Mobile Visual Computing`. This topic is not only about how machines perceive visual information, but also how machines present visual information to us! My current interests include but are not limited to in-sensor computing, point cloud-based computing and XR rendering. 

Please drop me an email if you are interested in working with me.
